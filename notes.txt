* Features
    - when citys are chosen, bring the sliders back and have a unique icon of the city that was chosen
    - If city is farther than driving distance make slider the plane otherwise have it be the car

* Ideas
    - When city is put in, gives a map of the city and using the google maps api it marks locations on there
    - Also giving a list of places on the side

    * Instead make it so that all you do is click 1 button. It finds the nearest city/town from you and shows the places on a map. It then gets the top places from that location
    Ultimately a sponaneous activity web app.
