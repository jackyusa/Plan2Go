# Plan2Go
## Project Overview 
Plan2Go is a website that utilized the Google Maps API where users can plan their next trip. It takes the users current location as reference, and then users can either search up a city where they want to go or randomize their destination city. Once a city is seleted, it will bring users to another slide with information about the city. After pressing the GO! button, users are taken to a slide where there are transportation options to get to the desired city.
